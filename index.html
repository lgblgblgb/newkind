	<h1>Elite - The New Kind (TNG)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.new-kind.com/">Original author's project page, download, etc</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/fesh0r/newkind">Source on github I forked</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/lgblgblgb/newkind">My repository on github</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The goal of my repository to try to modernize the source a bit
	(build system for multiple platforms), to port to SDL (instead of
	Allegro), and also targeting emscripten, ie a version which can
	run inside your web browser, to be able to check it out on any
	OS/platform then. Also fixing bugs, and maybe extending the project
	in the future as well somewhat, who knows.</p>
